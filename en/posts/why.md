There are several factors that drive me to achieve this finally.

* I have to admit that my english ability is not good enough and writing is part of it, which annoys me a lot. And I always try to find something that I like and can improve my english at the same time. I guess this is it.
* Honestly, I notice that the magnitude of the english tech blogs is not as much as chinese blogs, maybe programming is being popular and it's growing in China. I'd like to share my ideas, or maybe other hobbies with more people around the world.
* More communication with world outside is always what I pursue all the time. By knowing more about better people, it's the most satisfying thing that I've done.


Thanks for your views on my blog!
