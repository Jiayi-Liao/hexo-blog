Lucky for me to experience the accident now instead of taking this in the future that when I dive deeper.

In the last dive on 9th, I mistakenly exceed the decopression limit time and  not finish the decompression stop, according to my dive computer.

## Experience

On my first day arriving there, I found that my dive parterners breathe much faster than me and the guage showed 80 or 90 bars left every time I finish my dive. It made me try a little(2 or 3 meters) deeper than my dive master and everything went well until the last 4 dives in Sipadan.  

Sipadan is a beautiful dive island and it has divers limitation for each day. So we tried to stay longer so that we could enjoy more views. However in reality, we didn't stay underwater for a very long time because we have to deal with the current and it makes me tired. The worst thing happened in the last dive when I've swim for a while in the depth of 20m, the dive computer started beep,beep,beep... I took a look at the dive computer and saw a "DECO", which means how long it left until the decompression limit time and it was very closed, but I didn't what that means because I've never seen this before! So it's ignored by me. And it's also ignored by me when I really exceeded the decompression limit time.  

When we were doing the 3min-5m stop, I noticed that there was a "DECO STOP"  3m-12min tip on my dive computer, which means that I should have stayed 12 minutes at 3 meters, and I still didn't get it. I went up after six minutes with my buddies. And my dive computer started making beep sound continuously as soon as I left the water. I realised that I just made a big mistake and the no fly time and desaturation time on dive computer became 48 hours.

## Symptoms

So decompression for 6 minutes, I didn't feel anything wrong after I went back to hotel and I was told that I'm okay but no more diving in a few days by the dive master because this is not so terrible. But I'm still a bit scared and started looking for more information about decompression sickness and also canceled the flight. Six hours later, I got skin rashs on the inner side of my leg, but no more other symtoms. And 24 hours later, the symptoms didn't go worse, I decided to go back home and see a doctor there.  

I took a few flights after 48 hours and everything looks okay. After I returned home, I went to see a doctor, just wanted to make sure I was really okay. The doctor explained that decompression cannot be diagnosed by any instrument and I was suggested to take a treatment in Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber. And I did after the doctor asked me something about the dive like depth, duration and frequency and so on.

##  Suggestion

I have to say that this accident really scares me. I've got so many chances to make this right in the last dive, but I missed them all. I can't imagine what this will be if I am on a liveboard or I am divng at a deeper depth. It's like a blow on my head and I've got some expriences.

1. Know your dive computer. Stop doing anything with potential risk before you understand the dive computer underwater. And ask your dive master if you can't figure it out.
2. Safty first, don't be too confident especially several dives in a row.
3. Buy dive insurance...
